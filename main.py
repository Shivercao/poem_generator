"""
This is an example of an ensemble of character lstm networks
using a corpus of spanish poems with the purpose of generating
new ones.

the text  is obtained from 'http://amediavoz.com/'. The website
 is searched by the web_scrapper module to obtain all poems in it.
 
Text files with all poems of each author are saved to temp dir in an
intermediate step between web_scraping and charlstm.
These occupy aprox, 8Mb on disk so it shouldnÂ´t be a problem.

Theres basically three clases
Data_Preparation to prepare data from corpus to input into the model
CharLSTM_Model which sets up LSTM model and trains it
PoemGenerator which generates poems using the trained models.

The whole process may take a while ..
